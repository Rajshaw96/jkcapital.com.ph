        <h3>How It works</h3>
        <p>Receivables financing allows you to unlock liquidity without taking on additional debt. Once your receivables purchase orders, invoices, or check payments are verified, JK Capital advances a percentage of their value.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Access funds tied up in confirmed sales or billed invoices.</li>
          <li>Continue collecting payments from your customers as usual.</li>
          <li>Repay or replenish the facility as payments come in.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>The result: </strong>consistent working capital without waiting 30, 60, or 90 days for collections.</p>
