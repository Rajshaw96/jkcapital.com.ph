      <p>
        At JK Capital, we look beyond traditional loans to uncover the real strength of your business — your receivables. These are earned but untapped assets that can be converted into immediate working capital.

        <h3>How we structure funding</h3>
        <p>We assess your cash flow structure and buyer relationships, act quickly to advance funds based on verified receivables, and adapt your facility as your sales volume or client terms evolve. You get funding that adapts to your sales rhythm, not the other way around.</p>

        <h3>How It works</h3>
        <p>Receivables financing allows you to unlock liquidity without taking on additional debt. Once your receivables — purchase orders, invoices, or check payments — are verified, JK Capital advances a percentage of their value.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Access funds tied up in confirmed sales or billed invoices.</li>
          <li>Continue collecting payments from your customers as usual.</li>
          <li>Repay or replenish the facility as payments come in.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>The result: </strong>consistent working capital without waiting 30, 60, or 90 days for collections.</p>

        <h3>When it's the right solution for you</h3>
        <p>This type of short-term funding helps you preserve healthy cash flow so you’re ready for recurring operational costs and growth opportunities. It’s ideal for you if:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>You issue invoices or POs with payment terms longer than 30 days.</li>
          <li>You’re expanding and need working capital to fulfill new orders.</li>
          <li>You have dependable buyers but slow-paying clients.</li>
          <li>You prefer flexible, transaction-based funding over traditional loans.</li>
        </ul>

          <li>Manage day-to-day expenses while waiting for client payments.</li>
          <li>Maintain healthy supplier relationships through timely payments.</li>
          <li>Strengthen liquidity for growth or new projects.</li>
