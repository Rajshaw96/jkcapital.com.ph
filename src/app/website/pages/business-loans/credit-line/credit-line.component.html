      <h2>One Approval, Capital On Demand.</h2>
      <p>
        We assess your cash cycles, receivables, and payment flows to align the limit and repayment plan with your rhythm. Once approved, you’re given an available credit limit that you can draw from anytime to cover operational needs.

        <h3>How It’s structured.</h3>
        <p>A Credit Line may be structured as secured or unsecured. Secured Credit Line: Backed by collateral such as property, inventory, or receivables. Offers higher limits and better rates. Unsecured Credit Line: Based on cash flow and credit standing. Faster to access, ideal for smaller or recurring needs.</p>
